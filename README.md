Pharmacy Sales Analysis Dashboard

1. Data Cleaning Process

Before creating the Power BI dashboard, the dataset was cleaned to ensure accurate and meaningful insights. The following steps were taken:

i. Handling Missing Values:

Numerical Columns: Missing values were replaced using the mean to maintain consistency without skewing the data.

Categorical Columns: Missing values were replaced using the mode (most frequent value) to ensure logical categorization.

ii. Removing Duplicates:

Checked for and removed duplicate records to avoid redundant calculations and prevent data distortion.

iii. Standardizing Data Formats:

Ensured uniform formatting for date, text, and numerical fields to improve consistency in reporting.
